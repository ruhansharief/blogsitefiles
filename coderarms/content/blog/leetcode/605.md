### **Problem Statement**

You have a long flowerbed in which some plots are already planted and some are not. However, flowers **cannot be planted in adjacent plots**.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`s and `1`s, where `0` means empty and `1` means planted, and an integer `n`, return `True` if `n` new flowers can be planted in the flowerbed **without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule**, and `False` otherwise.

---

### Examples

**Example 1**  
>Input: `flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, `n = 1`  
>Output: `True`

**Example 2**  
>Input: `flowerbed = [1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, `n = 2`  
>Output: `False`

### **Initial Thoughts and Approach**

At first glance, the logic seems simple for me:
- Iterate through the flowerbed.
- For each plot, check the left, current, and right positions.
- If all three are `0`, a flower can be planted.

However, edge I have missed considering the edge case scenarios such as:
- `[0, 0, 1]`, `[1, 0, 0]`, `[0]`, `[0, 0]`

Initially, I tried starting the loop at index 2 to avoid index errors, but this created more complexity in managing edge cases.

---

### **Learnings**

- Avoid shortcuts like starting the loop at index 2 **just to prevent index errors**; it's better to write explicit, readable conditions for edge positions.
- Handle **edge cases** by understanding what positions are truly "safe" for planting.
- Use **short-circuiting** logic for clean condition checking. See the [blog post](/blog/leetcode/short-circuit) page for more details.
- The solution modifies the input array in-place but could be adjusted to avoid mutation if required.

---

### **Steps**

1. Iterate through the flowerbed from start to end.
2. For each position:
   - Assign `left_spot` and `right_spot` safely to handle edges:
     - At index `0`, the left spot is considered `0`.
     - At the last index, the right spot is considered `0`.
3. If the current spot and both adjacent spots are `0`, it is safe to plant:
   - Decrease `n` by 1.
   - Mark that position in the flowerbed as planted (`1`).
4. After the loop, if `n <= 0`, return `True`, otherwise `False`.

> [!NOTE] 
> This solution works in O(n) time and O(1) space (in-place update).

### **Python Code**

```python
def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(flowerbed)):

        # Determine left spot
        if i == 0:
            left_spot = 0
        else:
            left_spot = flowerbed[i - 1]

        # Determine right spot
        if i == len(flowerbed) - 1:
            right_spot = 0
        else:
            right_spot = flowerbed[i + 1]

        current_spot = flowerbed[i]

        # Check if planting is possible
        if current_spot == 0 and left_spot == 0 and right_spot == 0:
            flowerbed[i] = 1
            n -= 1

    return n <= 0
```
### **Python Code - Short Circuiting**

```python
def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(flowerbed)):
        
        left_spot = (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0 )
        right_spot = (i == len(flowerbed) - 1) or (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0)
        current_spot = flowerbed[i]

        # Check if planting is possible
        if current_spot == 0 and left_spot and right_spot:
            flowerbed[i] = 1
            n -= 1

    return n <= 0
```
### **Python Code - Short Version**
```python
def canPlaceFlowers(flowerbed, n) -> bool:
    for i in range(len(flowerbed)):
        # Check if planting is possible
        if current_spot == 0 and (i == 0) or (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0 ) and (i == len(flowerbed) - 1) or (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0):
            flowerbed[i] = 1
            n -= 1

    return n <= 0
```
