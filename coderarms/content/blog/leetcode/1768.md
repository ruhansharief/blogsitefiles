## **Problem Statement** 
Given two strings **`word1`** and **`word2`**, merge them by taking characters alternately from each. Begin with the first character of **`word1`**, followed by the first character of **`word2`**, and so on. If one string is longer than the other, append the remaining characters of the longer string at the end.

**Example 1:**

> Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
> Output: "apbqcr"

*Explanation:* The merged string will be merged as so:
```
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
```
**Example 2:**
>Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
>Output: "apbqrs"

*Explanation:* Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
```
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q r s
merged: a p b q r s
```


## **Approach**

Things to consider:
1. This is an easy problem that can be solved efficiently using a two-pointer technique.
2. Since Python strings are immutable, adding characters to a string in a loop (e.g., via +=) creates a new string each time, leading to poor performance. To avoid this, collect characters in a list and join them into a string at the end, which is more memory-efficient.
3. The goal is to achieve:

    * **Time complexity:** O(n + m)
    * **Space complexity:** O(n + m)

>[!NOTE]
> where n is length of word1 and m is length of word2

*Steps:*
- Assign two pointers, each one pointing to first character in each string. Lets take them as **`word1_pointer`** and **`word2_pointer`** and assing them to `0` (first character)
- Assign a empty list **`merged_list`** to save the characters alternatively. (Lists in python are like dynamic arrays)
- Run a loop **`n+m`** times because the final list will be of length **`n+m`** (length of both **`word1`** and **`word2`** added)
- Start with **`word1`** and in each iteration, keep adding the character to which each pointer is pointing to the list. And then increment the pointers.
- Since the loop runs for the length **`n+m`**, we need some condition inside the loop for scenarios like **`n>m`** or **`n<m`** and that condition would be to check the pointer is not crosing the length of the string.
- At the end of the loop, we will have a all the characters alternatively as items in **`merged_list`**. Join them together as as string and return it.

>[!NOTE]
>The list to string conversion is also of time complexity O(n) which doesn't change the order of n.


## **Code**
```python
def mergeAlternately(word1: str, word2: str) -> str:

  word1_pointer = 0
  word2_pointer = 0

  merged_list = []

  for iteration in range(len(word1)+len(word2)):
    if word1_pointer < len(word1):
      merged_list.append(word1[word1_pointer])
      word1_pointer += 1

    if word2_pointer < len(word2):
      merged_list.append(word2[word2_pointer])
      word2_pointer += 1

  return "".join(merged_list)

print(mergeAlternately("abc","pqr"))
```
